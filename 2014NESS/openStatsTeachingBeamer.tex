\begin{frame}{What is statsTeachR.org?}

\begin{block}{The basics}
\begin{itemize}
        \item a new, open-access, online repository with modular lesson plans
        \item materials targeted at undergraduates and graduates 
        \item topics: stats, biostats, statistical computing with R
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Modules}
\begin{itemize}
        \item each curricular ``module'' focuses on teaching a particular statistical subject or concept
        \item can be browsed \`a la carte
\end{itemize}

 \begin{quote}
\footnotesize
...the problem with open source textbooks, software, videos and other materials is that they ultimately declare to students, to administrators and to the public that faculty intellectual creations have no market value, and hence, are worthless.  When all information wants to be free, who will employ information producers, be it be lecturers, expositors, musicians, architects, poets?
